Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses.<br>

### How To Run The Program
For this program, you will need to copy 1 files.<br>
   1. <a href="https://github.com/Theresiap/Personal-Project/blob/master/Stopwatch/Stopwatch.md">Main Code</a>

When loading the main code, you will need two lines:<br>
   1. The first line is to start the stopwatch
   2. The second line is to stop the stopwatch and add more laps

For the changed code, you can input your chosen word by changing the word in the bracket.
```python
hangman('You can put anything here')
```
