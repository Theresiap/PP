Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses.<br>

### How To Run The Program
For this game, you will need to copy 2 files. Make sure both files are saved in the same directory.<br>
   1. <a href="https://github.com/Theresiap/Personal-Project/blob/master/Hangman/Hangman-Game.md">Main Code</a>
   3. <a href="https://github.com/Theresiap/Personal-Project/blob/master/Hangman/words.txt">Word List</a>

When loading the main code, you will need two lines (fixed code and changed code). <br>
For the fixed code, this should appear when the code is run. This is 3 different tests: checking if the word list is accesible, 'apple' works with the code, and that all letters appear.
```
Loading word list from file...
   0 words loaded.
_pp_e
abcdfghjlmnoqtuvwxyz
```
For the changed code, you can input your chosen word by changing the word in the bracket.
```python
hangman('You can put anything here')
```
